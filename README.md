Installation & Dependencies
---------------------------
To build the performance tests (MatrixMultiply, Prox, etc.) you need the built tool [cmake](
http://www.cmake.org).
The performance tests only depend on the matrix library [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) at least version 3. Download it and install it on your system.
You need CUDA installed on your system as well, download and install the latest [CUDA API and Drivers](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).

Download the latest CudaFramework code:
```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/gabyx/CudaFramework.git CudaFramework  
```
Make a build directory and navigate to it:
```bash
    $ mkdir Build
    $ cd Build
```
Invoke cmake in the Build directory:
```bash
    $ cmake ../CudaFramework
```
The cmake script will find Eigen and Cuda if you installed it in a system wide folder (e.g ``/usr/local/``)


Finally, build the performance tests:
```bash
    $ make all 
    $ make install
``` 
 To build in parallel use the ``-jN`` flag in the `make` commmand, where ``N``denotes the number of parallel threads to use.

Supported Platforms
--------------------------
The code has been tested on Linux and OS X with compilers ``clang`` and ``gcc``. 
It should work for Windows as well, but has not been tested.


##Example Usage

The target ``PerformanceProx`` contains the parallel GPU implementation of the **projective overrelaxed Jacobi (JORProx)** and **succesive overrelaxed Gauss-Seidel (SORProx, SORProxRelaxed)** iterations used in multi-body dynamics.
The target ``PerformanceMatrix`` contains the performance test of the efficient parallel matrix-multiplication kernel which is used for the JORProx implementation.
The target ``GaussSeidelTest`` contains the test launches of the parallel linear Gauss-Seidel algorithm.

The performance tests are all written in the same structure. 
A performance tests of any kind of application can be specified with the ``PerformanceTest`` template class which accepts a test method as template argument.
For the kernel performance tests mainly used in this project, the test method ``KernelTestMethod`` is of main interest. It is used for profiling/checking a certain GPU implementation (``ProxTestVariant`` see below) against a serial CPU implementation. The results are saved in an XML file, with all output provided by the test method (e.g.  ``KernelTestMethod``). A python notebook``python/ParseXML.pynb`` is provided as an example to parse the performance tests output XML.


The following example shows how a performance test for the SORProx GPU Variant 1 is launched (target: ``PerformaceProx``):
```C++
    typedef KernelTestMethod< /* Specify a kernel test method */ 
    
        KernelTestMethodSettings<false,true,0> ,  /* Specify the general kernel test method settings */ 
        
        ProxTestVariant< /* Specify the specific variant of the kernel test method */ 
            
            ProxSettings< /* All settings for the prox test variant */ 
        
               double,                  /* use double floating point precision */ 
               SeedGenerator::Fixed<5>, /* the seed for the random value generator for the test data */ 
               false,                   /* Write the test data to a file (matlab style) */ 
               1,                       /* Max. iterations of the prox iteration */
               false,                   /* Abort iteration if prox iteration converged */
               10,                      /* Convergence check every 10 iterations */
               true,                    /* Compare the GPU implementation to the exact serial replica on th CPU */
               ProxPerformanceTestSettings<3000,20,4000,3>,                /* Problem sizes from 3000 contacts to 4000 in steps of 20, generate 3 random test problems per problem size*/
               SorProxGPUVariantSettings<1,ConvexSets::RPlusAndDisk,true>  /* Use the GPU Variant 1, align the memory on the GPU for coalesced access!*/
            >
            
        >
        
    > test1;
    
    PerformanceTest<test1> A("SorProxVariant1D"); /* output file written to: SorProxVariant1D***.xml*/
    A.run();
```

### Understanding JORProx and SORProx
To understand the workflow of the performance tests and application of the **JORProx** and **SORProx**, the user is encouraged to understand the basic workflow of the ``ProxTestVariant`` in ``ProxTestVariant.hpp``.
This class contains the basic initialization of the used matrices for the numerical iterations, the two important functions
``ProxTestVariant::runOnGPU()`` and ``ProxTestVariant::runOnCPU()`` which run the specified variant (e.g. SORProx GPU Variant 1 in the above example) 
on the CPU or the GPU, and a check routine
``ProxTestVariant::checkResults()`` which compares the results from the GPU to the CPU.
The function call ``ProxTestVariant::runOnGPU()`` calls the ``runGPUProfile()`` function of the templated type ``ProxTestVariant::m_gpuVariant``.

**The GPU variants for the type ``m_gpuVariant`` of the JORProx and SORProx can be found in ``SorProxGPUVariant.hpp`` and ``JorProxGPUVariant.hpp``.** 
**These files will help the most in understanding the source code together with the paper.**

Each GPU variant class (e.g. ``JorProxGPUVariant``,  ``SorProxGPUVariant``) contains certain variants (ennumerated with ids 1,2,3, ...) which mostly correspond to fixed GPU settings (block dimension, threads per block etc...).
The descriptions of these variants are consistent with the master thesis (and hopefully also the paper).
A GPU variant class (e.g. ``JorProxGPUVariant``, ``SorProxGPUVariant``) has a ``initializeTestProblem()`` function which fills the iteration matrices with random values (keeping the problem size fixed!). They also have ``runGPUProfile()`` and ``runGPUPlain()`` functions which run the specified variant id (e.g variant 1 of ``SorProxGPUVariant`` in the example above) with or without timing information.

To get at the bottom of the source code, that means to the actual code of the prox iteration, consider the kernels A and B of all variants in ``SorProxGPUVariant`` (see ``runKernel()`` function). This variant is described in the paper in detail. Kernels A and B are launched sequentially over the iteration matrix ``T_dev`` as shown in the following:
```C
    for(m_nIterGPU=0; m_nIterGPU< m_nMaxIterations ; m_nIterGPU++){

            // Swap pointers of old and new on the device
            std::swap(x_old_dev.m_pDevice, x_new_dev.m_pDevice);

            for(int kernelAIdx = 0; kernelAIdx < loops; kernelAIdx++){

               //cudaThreadSynchronize();
               proxGPU::sorProxContactOrdered_1threads_StepA_kernelWrap<SorProxSettings1>(
                  mu_dev,x_new_dev,T_dev,d_dev,
                  t_dev,
                  kernelAIdx,
                  pConvergedFlag_dev,
                  m_absTOL,m_relTOL);

               proxGPU::sorProx_StepB_kernelWrap<SorProxSettings1>(
                  t_dev,
                  T_dev,
                  x_new_dev,
                  kernelAIdx
                  );

            }
    }
```
The core of the GPU kernel implementations can be found in the file ``ProxGPU.cu, KernelsProx.cuh`` and with the C++ wrapper calls in ``ProxGPU.hpp``.

### Interfacing with Own Code
The best way to use the SORProx or JORProx GPU implementations right out of the box is to instantiate the following
variant types somewhere in your code:
```C++
   JorProxGPUVariant< JorProxGPUVariantSettingsWrapper<PREC,5,ConvexSets::RPlusAndDisk,true,1000,true,10,false, TemplateHelper::Default>, ConvexSets::RPlusAndDisk > m_jorGPUVariant;

   SorProxGPUVariant< SorProxGPUVariantSettingsWrapper<PREC,1,ConvexSets::RPlusAndDisk,true,1000,true,10,true,  TemplateHelper::Default >,  ConvexSets::RPlusAndDisk > m_sorGPUVariant;
```
Please see the file ``ProxSettings.hpp`` for the settings of ``SorProxGPUVariantSettingsWrapper`` and ``JorProxGPUVariantSettingsWrapper``, the number 1000 denotes the maximal number of global prox iterations.
These variants are the fastest methods so far (at least for the NIVIDIA GTX 580), you can try to tweak the settings in ``ProxKernelSettings.hpp`` for the JORProx and SORProx to gain better speeds for your GPU. 

Launching the iterations would look similar to this example:

```C++
        m_jorGPUVariant.setSettings(m_settings.m_MaxIter,m_settings.m_AbsTol,m_settings.m_RelTol);
        gpuSuccess = m_jorGPUVariant.runGPUPlain(P_front,m_T,P_back,m_d,m_mu);
        m_globalIterationCounter = m_jorGPUVariant.m_nIterGPU;
        /* OR */
        m_sorGPUVariant.setSettings(m_settings.m_MaxIter,m_settings.m_AbsTol,m_settings.m_RelTol);
        gpuSuccess = m_sorGPUVariant.runGPUPlain(P_front,m_T,P_back,m_d,m_mu);
        m_globalIterationCounter = m_jorGPUVariant.m_nIterGPU;
```
Matrices ``m_T`` and ``m_d`` are built as described in the paper. Vector ``m_mu`` are the friction coefficients for all contacts which consist of a normal and two tangential forces. The percussions ``P_back`` and ``P_front`` are contact ordered and each contact tuple consits of (normal percussion, tangential percussion 1, tangential percussion 2, see the description in the paper).

## Example Usage Sparse JORProx Velocity
In this section some short explanations of the sparse JORProx scheme which iterates in the velocities should be given.
This implementation is based on the master thesis of Thierry Baasch available here [1](http://www.zfm.ethz.ch/~nuetzig/files/projectiveBaasch.pdf)
and is closely related to the implementation of 

> Million Body Simulations of Granular Dynamics on the GPU,â H. Mazhar, T. Heyn, A. Tasora, M. Anitescu, D. Negrut, accepted, SIAM Conference on Computational Science and Engineering, Reno, NV, 2011

We used a specialized segmented reduction kernel adapted from [ModernGPU](http://www.moderngpu.com) for the velocity update of the bodies.
